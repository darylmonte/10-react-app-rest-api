# Rest API
My ninth project for the Treehouse Full-Stack Javascript Techdegree. I created a REST API using Express to provide a way to administer a school database containing information about users and courses. Users can interact with the database to create new courses, retrieve information on existing courses, and update or delete existing courses. To make changes to the database, users will be required to log in so the API will also allow users to create a new account or retrieve information on an existing account.

## Getting Started
Complete these steps in the root folder where you installed your files using the terminal:
1. Install Project Dependencies: npm install
2. Populate the database by using: npm run seed
3. Run the API use: npm start
4. Access the API: [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)
